                       <h3>Monkey Trails</h3>
                       <p>Monkey Trails showcases monkeys and other animals from the rainforests of Asia and Africa. Opened in 2005,[34] it replaced an older exhibit known as the Monkey Yard. Monkey Trails is home primarily to monkeys such as guenons, mangabeys, Angola colobuses, tufted capuchins, spider monkeys, and mandrills, but it also showcases many other species of animals, such as yellow-backed duikers Ethana(f),Lucius(m) and Peep(f)When Peep rejected Ethana,Lucus stepped in to take care of her,which was not expected as male duikers do not take care of foals. pygmy hipposMabel(f),Elgon(m) and Akobi(m).Last month,After weeks of anticpation,Mabel gave birth to Akhobi,a male calf,The first calf born at the zoo.And slender-snouted crocodiles. Many species of turtles, snakes, lizards, and fish can be seen in a series of water/land exhibits with underwater viewing areas. In smaller exhibits, many reptiles and amphibians such as pancake tortoises can be found, along with many species of arthropods such as Madagascar hissing cockroaches. Monkey Trails utilizes a new method of displaying arboreal animalsâ€”by climbing up an elevated walkway throughout the exhibit. Some of the horticultural highlights in Monkey Trails include a ficus tree, cycads, and a bog garden.</p>
